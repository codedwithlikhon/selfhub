# selfhub

Let’s make a tight, structured plan for #SelfHub — assuming it’s your idea for a personal AI-driven developer hub or digital workspace (correct me if not).


---

🧠 Core Idea

SelfHub is your all-in-one personal operating system for AI, projects, and productivity — a fusion of GitHub-style repositories, Notion-style organization, and agent-powered automation.


---

⚙️ Phase 1 — Foundation (MVP)

Goal: Get a functional core running locally or on the web.

Frontend: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui

Backend: FastAPI or Supabase + Gemini 1.5 Pro / OpenAI API

Database: Postgres (via Supabase)

Features:

User auth (email + magic link or Google OAuth)

Dashboard showing projects, notes, and AI sessions

File-based storage for code + markdown

AI chat with memory + command execution (e.g. “create repo”, “summarize doc”)




---

🧩 Phase 2 — Intelligence Layer

Goal: Make SelfHub feel alive and useful.

Integrate AI Agents (your “Self” instances)

Add embeddings search for semantic recall

Auto-tag + auto-summarize your work

Voice/text interface for commands (“Start project ‘EchoEngine’”)



---

🌐 Phase 3 — Cloud & Collaboration

Goal: Share, sync, and grow the ecosystem.

Cloud sync across devices

Team mode: shared hubs, project roles, chat memory

GitHub API integration for mirroring repos

Publish projects or AI personas as open modules



---

💡 Phase 4 — Autonomy & Ecosystem

Goal: Turn SelfHub into an autonomous productivity platform.

Self-updating AI workflows

Plugin store for agents and tools

Cron-like AI tasks (auto reports, summaries, backups)

Local-first data control with encryption



---

🔮 Vision

> SelfHub = Your digital reflection — an intelligent, self-organizing workspace that learns your rhythm and amplifies your creativity.
